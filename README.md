# Data Structures in C++ 🚀

Welcome to the Data Structures in C++ repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to fundamental data structures implemented in C++.
Whether you're a student learning data structures or a developer refreshing your knowledge, you'll find examples of arrays, linked lists, stacks (array and linked list), and queues (array and linked list).

## Table of Contents 📚

1. [Arrays](/arrays): Implementation of dynamic arrays in C++.
2. [Linked Lists](/linked_lists): Doubly linked list implementation.
3. [Stacks](/stacks): Stack implementations using both arrays and linked lists.
4. [Queues](/queues): Queue implementations using both arrays and linked lists.

## Operations 🛠️

### Arrays 📊
- Insertion and deletion operations.
- Search and update operations.

### Linked Lists  🔗
- Insertion and deletion at the beginning, end, and specific positions.
- Displaying the linked list.
- Reversing the linked list.

### Stacks 📚🧊 
- Push and pop operations.
- Peek at the top element.
- Display
- Dispaly_reverse

### Queues 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️
-  Push and pop operations.
- Peek at the top element.
- Display
- Dispaly_reverse
